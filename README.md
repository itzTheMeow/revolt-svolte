## Svolte

Simply `pnpm i` and then `pnpm start` and go to [localhost:7859](http://localhost:7859)

#### ~~Standalone Build (NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL)~~

~~Svolte supports being built 'standalone'. This means it does not rely on the backend server.~~

~~Just run `pnpm run standalone` and a standalone version will be built in `dist`.``
